Need to standardize on a token format and signing algorithm.\n\nOptions Considered:\n1. JWT with HS256 (symmetric) — simpler but requires shared secret distribution\n2. JWT with RS256 (asymmetric) — more complex setup but better for service-to-service auth\n3. Opaque tokens with introspection endpoint — simpler tokens but adds latency\n\nDecision:\nJWT with RS256 (asymmetric signing).\n\nRationale:\n- Asymmetric signing means services only need the public key to verify tokens\n- No shared secret management headaches\n- Works well for both user-facing and service-to-service auth\n- Industry standard for our scale\n\nConsequences:\n- Need to set up key rotation infrastructure\n- Slightly larger token size\n- Team needs to understand RS256 key management\n\nApproval: Pending CTO review"

Launch date: We're working toward March 15 but there's moderate risk of a 1-2 week slip. The auth migration creates a dependency — Product team needs auth changes to product-api completed by Feb 14 to stay on track for integration testing.\n\n2. Main risks:\n   - Auth migration is a significant infrastructure change touching 14+ services\n   - We've designed a phased rollout to minimize disruption\n   - Product-api migration (Phase 2, Feb 10-14) is the critical path\n   - If Phase 1 slips, everything shifts\n\n3. For the board:\n   - Recommend framing as \"targeting March 15, with contingency to April 1\"\n   - The auth migration is necessary regardless — it addresses technical debt and security requirements\n   - All three teams are aligned and coordinating well\n\nI can prepare a more detailed brief if you'd like.\n\nLisa"
